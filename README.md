This is a repo for slides I created to potentially talk about the "Website Packaging" (WPACK) work that may or may not ever become work for the IETF.
These were for IETF 102 in July in Montreal.

The slides in `wpack-intro-ietf102.md` were developed to be processed by Marp - https://yhatt.github.io/marp/
